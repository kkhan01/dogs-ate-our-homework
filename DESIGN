DESCRIPTION:
    Project Name: Dogtris 


    A multiplayer tetris game pitting two players against each other, giving the win to the player who earns the most points. We wish to use networking to allow computers to connect. Instead of just pitting two computers only, other computers should be allowed to start a game as well. This will allow for multiple 2 player sessions to be active at once. If one of the players disconnects, it’s an automatic victory. We will be using SDL to allow users to interact with our game through a GUI and also allow us to implement complex features such as object collision, animations, and tracking object positions. 


VIRTUAL WHITEBOARD: (Features that can be added to the finished base game)
    - Animated dog goes across the row and ‘eats’ it
    - Sockets instead of pipes
    - Spectator system
    - Game won’t start until both players type `READY`

    - Board
      - consists of -1, 0, 1
      	- -1 is blocks already set in place
	- 0 is empty spaces where blocks can transverse through
	- 1 is a block in motion
	  - once it touches a -1 block, it changes to -1
	    - triggers the next block out
	  - has rotable attribute (binary)
      - once a line is completely -1:
      	- we remove the entire line
	- add to score
	- changes all blocks above to 1
      - always active gravity function?
      	- consistently moves all movable blocks down by 
    - tetronimo pseudocode
        struct tetronimo {
            // Struct of how the tetronimo is arranged
            struct arrangement;

            // Is the tertonimo rotatable
            // 0 if no
            // 1 if yes
            // Set to 0 once it touches a -1 block.
            int rotatable;

            // What is the space?
            // -1 if the space is a set block
            // 0 if the space is empty
            // 1 if the space contains a moving block
            int set;
        }

        struct arrangement {
            struct row r1; // Row 1
            struct row r2; // Row 2
            struct row r3; // Row 3
            struct row r4; // Row 4
        }

        struct row {
            int c1; // Column 1
            int c2; // Column 2
            int c3; // Column 3
            int c4; // Column 3
        }

USER INTERFACE:
    We will be using a GUI created from the library SDL.
    *SDL Compiling instructions


FEATURES | TECHNICAL DESIGN: 

    Structures concept:
        Semaphores to limit number of games in play at once 
        Allocated memory to keep track of the board states
        Server and subservers to administer multiple games and control each game separately
        - Done via forking
        Shared memory to allow for two players to have the same pieces at the same time?
        Storing game data with files as well as possible all-time leaderboards
        - Using stat to get the data from the files
        Networking with pipe-like structures -- sockets 
        Signaling to confirm whether or not the user really wants to exit
        - If they do, the opponent gets a victory and both clients exit?
    Breakdown: (Refer to codenames section)
        - Server / Subserver: KK
        - Game Board (UI) / Save States: AJ
        - Game logic / Signaling: KK
        - Networking: AJ

STRETCH:
	- Networking [moved due to abscence of a team member]
